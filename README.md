Abstract

This study presents a novel approach to systematically measure climatic and environmental exposure in refugee camps using remote sensing and geospatial data. Using a case study of seventeen refugee camps across five countries in East Africa, we develop an climatic and environmental exposure index to quantify each camp's level of exposure and variability relative to a population of simulated camp locations within the country. Our results show that seven of seventeen refugee camps are within the upper two quartiles of exposure relative to a simulated population, suggesting that the approximately six-hundred thousand refugees living in these camps face elevated exposure compared to other potential camp locations. This method stands to improve the process of gathering climatic and environmental data on remote spaces in a reliable, low-cost, and standardized manner. Moving forward, further refinement of this index and additional automation could enable real-time updates on climatic and environmental exposure to support decision-making related to disaster risk and resilience in refugee camp management.
